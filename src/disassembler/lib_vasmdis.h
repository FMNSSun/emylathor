   Disassembles the bytes provided as argument.
   Invalid encoded instructions are disassembled as far as possible and the

   Note: vasmdis_disasm_instruction is not threadsafe - it uses an internal buffer to store the
   disassembled parts
   
   Parameters:
     ins - the pointer to the first byte of an assembled instruction

   Returns:
     the disassembled instruction as string. the arguments are delimited by tabulators

     bytes - the raw encoded data of an instruction
