/* Function: dec_fetch_ins

   Fetches the next instruction. This function does all the necessary decoding.
   It internally fetches more data (like the register part or immediate data part) if necessary. 
   This function updates the position of the cpu_context in the emulator_context. It reads
   from the memory in the memory_context from emulator_context and uses the virtual address functions
   of memory.c. Therefore a call to this function might fire a page fault.

   Parameteres:
     ectx - Emulator context

   Returns:
  
   A pointer to an instruction context. The instruction context is statically allocated and therefore it's contents
   is overwritten by the next call to <dec_fetch_ins>. If you need the data of the preceeding call still after another
   call to this function you should (well, must) copy the data by yourself. You also should not free the context
   returned by this function (as it is reused by later calls to this function). If the function returns NULL
   there has been an error. This function fires the necessary page faults or invalid opcode exceptions if necessary.
