\subsection{Boot process}

On start up the CPU loads $40_{16}$ words from disk at position $00_{16}$ to position $20_{16}$
in memory. It initially disables interrupts. The stack pointer is set to $\text{1fff}_{16}$ and the
instruction pointer to $20_{16}$. You should write a boot loader which must be less than $40_{16}$
words long which loads additional programs from disk. A boot loader must be aware that it is not
loaded to position $00_{16}$ but to position $20_{16}$ which means that for example jump and call
addresses have a $20_{16}$ offset due to this.
