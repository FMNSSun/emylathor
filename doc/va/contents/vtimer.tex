\subsection{vtimer}

The vtimer is a timer capable of periodically firing an interrupt (HW-Int. No. 2). It can be programmed to wait a certain delay in milliseconds
between two interrupts (therefore the resolution is 1ms). The timer can be enabled and disabled. If the timer is disabled
it will not attempt to fire an interrupt. If the timer is disabled it will continue to run and therefore the exact state the timer is in
is undefined. If the timer is enabled and has a delay set of 10ms it might fire the next interrupt anywhere between 0 and 10ms (however, all following
interrupts are fired every 10ms) (thus the time between when the timer is enabled and the next interrupt fires is undefined). 

\subsubsection{Setting the delay}

The delay can be set by writing to port $2$. The current programmed delay can be read by reading from port $2$. $0$ is not a valid delay.

\subsubsection{Enabling/Disabling the timer}

When a zero is written to the timer port the timer will treat the next write to its port as a command. \\

\textbf{Commands:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $01_{16}$ - Enable Timer
	\item $02_{16}$ - Disable Timer
\end{itemize}
