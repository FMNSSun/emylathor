\subsection{vkbc}

vkbc is a simple keyboard controller. The keyboard controller is located behind port 1. If a key is pressed or released the
keyboard controller will fire an interrupt (HW-Int. No. 1). Once an interrupt is fired the keyboard controller will suspend its operation
until data is read from its port. If the CPU and/or operating system can't handle keyboard controller interrupts fast enough key presses
or key releases are lost. If you read from the keyboard controller port the lowest word contains the scancode and the highest bit is set
if the key was pressed. If the highest bit is not set then the key was released. Since \emph{emulathor} uses SDL to emulate the keyboard
it also uses SDL-Scancodes (see \verb|http://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Scancode|).
