\section{Overview}

\subsection{VA Processor}

The VA processor is a processor with a Load and Store-, Little-Endian-architecture using a RISC instruction set with a fixed instruction length of 32 bits. It has 16 accessible general purpose registers and a few control registers. The processor has a built-in Memory Management Unit. 

\subsubsection{Modes}

The processor supports an unprivileged mode and a privileged mode to protect access to hardware and memory. 

\subsubsection{Alignment}

Access to unaligned addresses is prohibited and will fire an exception. For byte accesses the data
needs to be byte aligned, for word accesses the data needs to be word aligned (address must be a multiple of 2) and for dword accesses the data needs to be dword aligned (address must be a multiple of four). 

\subsection{Cache}

To speed up memory access there's a cache between the processor and memory. 

\subsection{DMA}

To support transfers from and to memory without involving the processor VA has a \Gls{DMA} controller.

\subsection{External Hardware}

VA has a keyboard, a timer and a graphics card with a text mode and a RGB mode.
