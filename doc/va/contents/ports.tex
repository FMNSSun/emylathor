\section{Ports}

VA supports up to 128 ports (0 - 127). All ports are 32 bit and therefore support reading and writing dwords. Some ports may choose to ignore
read or write attempts. 

\subsection{Port Map}

Below is given the standard Port Map of VA. This Port Map may be extended (but not changed) by other hardware. A VA-compatible computer
must at least support the standard Port Map. 

\begin{tabular}{ | r | l | }
	\hline
	\textbf{Number} & \textbf{Description} \\
	\hline
	$00_{16}$ & This port allows to save a 32 bit value. \\
                  & Every read attempt will return the value from the last write attempt. \\
	\hline
	$01_{16}$ & Keyboard Controller Port (vkbc) \\
	\hline
	$02_{16}$ & Timer Port (vtimer) \\
	\hline
	$10_{16}$ & Graphic Card Port (vagc) \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
