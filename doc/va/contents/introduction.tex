\section{Introduction}

VA describes a simplified computer and its behaviour without specifying how the behaviour is implemented in hardware. 
Currently there is no hardware implementation of VA. The main goal of VA is to provide a simplified
computer for educational purposes. 

\subsection{About sizes}

Although usually the term 'word' is used for the CPU's native 'word size' it has been and still is common to use word to refer to 16 bits and dword (double word) to 32 bits. We follow this exact convention and therefore a byte is 8 bits, a word is 16 bits, a dword is 32 bits and a qword is 64 bits.
